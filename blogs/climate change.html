Climate change is the burning issue that the world is facing today. Climate change is largely a manmade crisis or a manmade calamity. During the global lockdown, it has been noticed that the environmental pollution has drastically been reduced across the large cities in the world, the climatic health has improved and the world has become a better place to live for all the living beings. The lock down improvement in the environmental quality is a proof that the uncontrolled human activities in terms of greedy industrialization, large scale manufacturing, transportation and warehousing and global trade of industrial products has severe and serious adverse impacts upon the global environment and climate.
Uncontrolled and unnecessary human activities add to environmental pollution, unjust exploitation of natural resources, global warming, extinction of biodiversity, unexpected pandemics like COVID-19, and many more unpredictable crises and calamities yet to come. While a large number of people relax under the air conditioners in hot summer, Adélie penguin, Corals and Quiver trees are gradually disappearing from the face of the earth. Golden toads are already extinct. 
Researchers have proved that the global warming is a direct threat to a children's ability to survive. Children below the age of five are the worst hit. Today, the children are growing up in an unstable world due to changing climate and degraded habitat. What is sad about the situation is that in spite of having adequate knowledge and information about the climate friendly living and environmental conservation, there is little attitudinal and behavioural change in the people. What is awesome is that the policy makers have been extraordinarily slow to take action.
Children can change the situation, if they will. We can change all this, but only if we act now before it's too late. We, young people, have a vital role in solving these crises. Young people can organize digital strikes now during this lockdown period. They can post their videos conveying their displeasure and protest on the social media. Once the lockdown is lifted, the children can organize and perform street plays. Street play is a good choice as it catches the interest of the passers-by. 
Apart from conducting online and offline protests, the children can lead a new way of eco friendly and climatically resilient lifestyle. They can figure out how to use less energy, spread awareness through social media, plant trees and look after them, form and propagate climate clubs, practice and profess ways and means of recycling wet and dry wastes, conservation of drinking water, efficient use of water for washing, cleaning, bathing and farming, encourage walking and cycling for covering short distances, use the public transportation for long distances and many more eco friendly ways of living.
There are several organizations, like ‘Fridays for Future’, ‘Sunrise Movement’ and ‘Sustain Us’ that engage young people for climatic action. Partnering with these movements the youngsters can advocate for the use of electric vehicles and solar cookers to replace the use of fossil fuels. Solar energy, wind energy, hydroelectricity, tidal energy and geothermal energy need to replace wood, oil and gas-fired power plants.
During the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the global community has shown solidarity to overcome the crisis. With regard to climate action and environmental protection, every child has a creative role to play. It is only when we work in solidarity our small acts can conquer great challenges. Therefore, let us join together, in taking climate action. It is the only way we can create a better world. Inspired by Greta Thunberg, a 16- year- old climate activist, on 15 March, 2019 ab…
